# Enchantment-Transfer
Enchantment Transfer is a lightweight Minecraft mod for Forge 1.18.2 which allows the player to transfer enchantments from item to book at the cost of XP.

Why use this mod?

**Fair Play** - Emulates the Vanilla anvil calculations to ensure a fair XP requirement for any transfer

**Configurable** - Want to cut the XP cost in half or set it to a fixed amount of levels no matter what? Checkout the mod's config!

**Vanilla Friendly** - Adds ZERO (0) Items, Blocks, or Ores

**Up to Date** - Supports the latest version of Minecraft 1.18.2 (and version 1.18.1)

**Modpack Friendly** - You are free to use this mod in any modpack as long as you link them to me on discord at Keni#5329 afterwards!

 

NOTE:

Enchantment Transfer currently only works with blank books as presented above, but support for combining enchantments with already enchanted books will come soon!

Free anvil transactions are not natively supported by Minecraft, so they do not work in this mod. Setting the fixed XP level to 0 will still cost 1 XP level. This will be fixed in later versions :)
